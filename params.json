{"name":"Peertask","tagline":"A collaborative todo list encouraged and managed by peers or friends, family and colleagues.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nBasically, this is a todo list manager. It likes to handle all non-professional tasks or hobbies one might have. Live moving the lawn, buying milk everyday, continue to painting the garage, working on open source projects, etc  \r\n\r\nThese tasks have different levels of motivation, and they have different levels of benefits too. Like waves, the enthusiasm to keep working on so many tasks or hobbies goes up and down. The push to keep working has to be more than just self motivation. Thats where everyone close to us can help in with the push. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
